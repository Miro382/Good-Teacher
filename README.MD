# Good Teacher

Good Teacher is a free program used for creating interactive presentations, games, graphics and tests. The goal of the program is to make teaching more attractive and to improve the presentations. The program can display 3D models, interactive charts, QR codes, drawing canvas, buttons, response buttons, form elements, web pages, galleries, videos, mathematical formulas and many other elements. We can export the entire presentation to a standalone executable program, leaving out the option of installing the program on all computers.
